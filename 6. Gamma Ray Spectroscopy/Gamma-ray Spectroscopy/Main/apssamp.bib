     abstract = "{The fundamental properties of the signal structure in Franck-Hertz
        experiments are analyzed. The central result is that the
        spacings between the minima in Franck-Hertz curves are not
        equidistant but increase linearly with the number of minima.
        This increase is especially pronounced at low atomic pressure.
        We suggest that the increase of the spacings is caused by the
        additional acceleration of electrons over their mean free path
        after the excitation energy is reached. Our model accurately
        estimates the lowest excitation energies of mercury (4.67eV) and
        neon (16.6eV) atoms and the mean free path of electrons in
        standard Franck-Hertz experiments. These results contradict the
        usual assumption that the spacings between successive minima or
        maxima are equal. We demonstrate that a standard Franck-Hertz
        apparatus can be upgraded to do more advanced experiments.}",
